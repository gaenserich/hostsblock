# hostsblock(8) -- ad-blocking and malware-blocking script for Linux

## SYNOPSIS

`hostsblock` [*options*]

## DESCRIPTION

Hostsblock is a bash script designed to take advantage of
/etc/hosts file to provide system-wide blocking of internet advertisements,
malicious domains, trackers, and other undesirable content.

To do so, it downloads a configurable set of blocklists and processes their
entries into a single /etc/hosts file.

Hostsblock also includes hostsblock-urlcheck(8), a command-line utility that
allows you to block and unblock certain websites and any other domains contained
in that website.
