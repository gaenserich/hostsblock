Version 0.999.6 (Alpha 6) (03.08.2017)
*Fixed parsing function that falsely expected gzip
*Fixed verbosity typo
*Fixed issue with hostsblock-urlblock symlink not reading from $1

*Mandate that hostsblock now runs as unpriviledged user, i.e. 'hostsblock' (see hostsblock.conf)
*Mandate the use of gzip for annotation file and HOSTS file backup
*Now uses /var/lib/hostsblock as its default configuration and /var/lib/hostsblock/cache as its default cache directories (to aid with priviledge containment).

*For performance improvements, replaced regex-aware grep with grep -F when regex not needed.

Version 0.999.3 (Alpha 3) (30.10.2015)
