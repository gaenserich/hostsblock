# CACHE DIRECTORY. Directory where blocklists will be downloaded and stored.

#cachedir="$HOME/cache" # DEFAULT

# WORK DIRECTORY. Temporary directory where interim files will be unzipped and
# processed. This directory will be deleted after hostsblock completes itself.

#tmpdir="/tmp/hostsblock" # DEFAULT

# FINAL HOSTSFILE. Final hosts file that combines together all downloaded blocklists.
# By default, hostsblock CANNOT directly write to /etc/hosts (See postprocess())
# below.

#hostsfile="$HOME/hosts.block" # DEFAULT. If not using a dns caching daemon

# REDIRECT URL. Url to which blocked hosts will be redirect, either 0.0.0.0 or
# 127.0.0.1. This replaces any entries to 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1. If you run a
# pixelserver such as pixelserv or kwakd, it is advisable to use 127.0.0.1.

#redirecturl="127.0.0.1" # DEFAULT

# ALLOW REDIRECTS. Give "1" here to allow entries from blocklists that redirect
# rather than just block. Redirects present a certain security hazard, so make
# sure that you trust your blocklist providers if you give "1" here. Redirects
# allow those who have corrupted DNS servers to access sites not available
# otherwise.

#redirects="0" # DEFAULT

# POSTPROCESSING. Commands to run after the new hostsfile has been
# created. You may restart your dns cacher here (see example).

# Default: Do nothing. This will NOT write to /etc/hosts.

#postprocess() {
#    true
#}

# Example 1: dnsmasq under systemd.
# If using dnsmasq under systemd, make sure you have the following
# line in /etc/dnsmasq.conf:
#
# addn-hosts=/var/lib/hostsblock/hosts.block
#
# Also make sure that the dnsmasq daemon has read priviledges
# for that file. For example, if dnsmasq runs under user
# "dnsmasq," add that user to the "hostsblock" group by
# typing the following in on the command line:
#
# sudo gpasswd -a dnsmasq hostsblock
#
# You will also have to give the user "hostsblock"
# sudo access to "/usr/bin/systemctl reload dnsmasq.service"
# Type the following:
#
# sudo visudo
#
# And then enter the following line at the bottom of the
# resulting document:
#
# hostsblock	ALL	=	(root)	NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/systemctl reload dnsmasq.service
#

#postprocess() {
#    sudo /usr/bin/systemctl reload dnsmasq.service
#}

# Example 2. Clobber /etc/hosts with $HOME/hosts.block. If not using a dns
# cacher, you may directly replace /etc/hosts with your generated file (by
# default at $HOME/hosts.block). Make sure you use the hostshead feature to
# preserve your original /etc/hosts file. We use "cp" here so that
# $HOME/hosts.block is preserved for hostsblock-urlcheck, recycling, and
# backup purposes. Add sudo permissions by typing at the command line:
#
# sudo visudo
#
# And then entering the following line at the bottom
# of the resulting document:
#
# hostsblock	ALL	=	(root)  NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cp
#

#postprocess() {
#    sudo cp $_v $hostsfile /etc/hosts
#}

# HEAD FILE. File containing hosts file entries which you want at the beginning
# of the resultant hosts file, e.g. for loopback devices and IPv6 entries. Use
# your original /etc/hosts file here if you are writing your final blocklist to
# /etc/hosts so as to preserve your loopback devices. Give hostshead="0" to
# disable this feature. For those targeting /etc/hosts, it is advisable to copy
# their old /etc/hosts file to this file so as to preserve existing entries.

#hostshead="0" # DEFAULT

# BLACKLISTED SUBDOMAINS. File containing specific subdomains to blacklist which
# may not be in the downloaded blacklists. Be sure to provide not just the
# domain, e.g. "google.com", but also the specific subdomain a la
# "adwords.google.com" without quotations.

#blacklist="$HOME/black.list" # DEFAULT

# WHITELIST. File containing the specific subdomains to allow through that may
# be blocked by the downloaded blocklists. In this file, put a space in front of
# a string in order to let through that specific site (without quotations), e.g.
# " www.example.com" will unblock "http://www.example.com" but not
# "http://subdomain.example.com". Leave no space in front of the entry to
# unblock all subdomains that contain that string, e.g. ".dropbox.com" will let
# through "www.dropbox.com", "dl.www.dropbox.com", "foo.dropbox.com",
# "bar.dropbox.com", etc.

#whitelist="$HOME/white.list"

# CONNECT_TIMEOUT. Parameter passed to curl. Determines how long to try to
# connect to each blocklist url before giving up.

#connect_timeout=60 # DEFAULT

# RETRY. Parameter passed to curl. Number of times to retry connecting to
# each blocklist url before giving up.

#retry=0 # DEFAULT

# MAX SIMULTANEOUS DOWNLOADS. Hostsblock can check and download files in parallel.
# By default, it will attempt to check and download four files at a time.

#max_simultaneous_downloads=4 # DEFAULT

# BACKUP_OLD. Save old hosts.block file. Passing "0" or "no" here has hostsblock
# NOT backup the old hosts.block file. Passing "1" or "yes" creates a gzip-
# compressed copy of the old file

#backup_old="no" # DEFAULT

# RECYCLE_OLD. If, for some reason, new downloaded blocklists contain fewer
# entries than previous versions, this option allows hostsblock to recycle the
# old main blocklist (e.g. hosts.block) so that old entries are preserved. In
# effect, the old hosts.block file becomes another downloaded blocklist.
# 1 = hostsblock WILL recycle old hosts.block, 0 = hostsblock will NOT.

#recycle_old=0 # DEFAULT

# VERBOSITY is not configured on the command line with the "-q" or "-v"
# flags.

# ANNOTATE. File where hostsblock will save information on which blocklist files
# affect which urls. Needed for hostsblock-urlcheck. This file will be gzipped.

#annotate="$HOME/hostsblock.db.gz" # DEFAULT

# COMPRESSION OPTIONS. hostsblock makes extensive use of gzip. Add any
# additional arguments to the gzip or pigz command here.

# pigz_opt="" # DEFAULT
# gzip_opt="" # DEFAULT

# BLOCKLISTS. List all blocklists to be downloaded as an array.Files may be
# either plaintext, zip, or 7z files. Hostsblock will automatically
# identify zip and 7z files.
